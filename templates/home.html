<h2>Purpose</h2>
<h5>Discrimination happens - <br>
<em>everywhere, anytime</em>. </h5>
<h5>We need a place to report it - <br>
<em>anywhere, anytime</em>.</h5>


<p> Our purpose here is to simply collect data. If you see or experience discrimination then report it. If you are part
of a charity, the police or are studying discrimination then please use our database to support your findings.
</p>
<p>
Data is so important to ensure the battle towards equality continues and does not plateau. So please get involved
and let's build a better future, together.
