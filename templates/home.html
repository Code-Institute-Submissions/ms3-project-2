<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Descrimination happens. Everywhere and at any time. Therefore, we need a quick and easy place to report it -
anywhere, anytime.
<br>
Our purpose here is to simply collect data. If you see or experience discrimination then report it. If you are part
of a charity, the police or are studying discrimination then please use our database to support your findings.
<br>
Data is so important to ensure the battle towards equality continues and does not plateu. So please get involved
and let's build a better future, together.
