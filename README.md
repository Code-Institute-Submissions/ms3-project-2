## Rationale

## Project proposal

The project aim to create a database of discrimination across the UK. It will allow users to take a stand and 
report any discrimination they experience, hear or see. They can categorise the discrimination and add a location.

Why collect data? Councils have made it clear that they are underfunded and that doesn't appear to be changing any
time soon. Yet, there is a rise in racist and xenophobic attacks across the country. 

This project will be open-sourced and all councils, police, charities and authories will have access to the data.
They can search by area or by discrimination to see where they can focus their efforts and funding.

## Responsive Design

This project has been optimised to the common devices on Google Chrome's Dev Tools.
It has been specifically designed for the following:

Through discussion with my mentor, we decided a matching pairs game would give me an appropriate challenge.
I received inspiration from playing Pokémon Go. I thought a great way to give the matching game a purpose would 
be to use Pokémon cards.
