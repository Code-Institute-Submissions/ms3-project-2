## Rationale

## Project proposal

The project aim to create a database of discrimination across the UK. It will allow users to take a stand and 
report any discrimination they experience, hear or see. They can categorise the discrimination and add a location.

This project will be open-sourced and all councils, police, charities and authories will have access to the data.
They can search by area or by discrimination to see where they can focus their efforts and funding.

## Inspiration

#### Requesting information

I designed this website to be as intuative and quick as possible. A major factor for not recording events is simply 
the amount of time it can take out of the day. Therefore, I designed my web site to only request the information
it necessary. 

I read an article explaining how to create a minimalist registering page at this link:
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/innovative-techniques-to-simplify-signups-and-logins/

Using it as inspiration, I simplified my registering form and allowed user to sign up as quickly as possible.
I also allowed them to add a preferred name once they were signed up, again speeding up the process.

I took this a step further with adding a new report or searching for a report. 

When adding a report, you are required to give information on whether the incident has been reported, 
the category of the incident and a description. As soon as that information was supplied, the incident was recorded.
After that, the user had the option to add extra details such as date and location. This offers flexibility to the
user and encourages use even if all the details aren't accessible.

When searching for a report, you only need to select the information necessary for your search. Otherwise, the Javascript
hides the extra information.

#### Design

I wanted this website to have a calm and mature theme - one that matches and reflects the sombre but important purpose.
In order to do this, I looked at two particular design websites that are linked below:
https://visme.co/blog/color-combinations/?fbclid=IwAR04pjyYtd1uGzsv9jQWIOkG3KCayjX2nGdH6xTy9WPapcLV0Xie3HKmWg0
https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/?fbclid=IwAR16fr1TqIOxw-Juvp4z_FFiHoHpONwH6D6g7Eud2-aVdneS0q2DHFfTWPg

I finally decided on one that had earth tones, which promoted calm and clarity. I attempted where possible to stick 
to as few colour as possible and ensured they complimented each other.

As there were not initial wireframes of the all the screen, I have added responsive images of all the pages in their final form.

<span id="defensiveFeatures"></span>
## Defensive Features

+ I wanted to make sure that the users inputted all the information necessary for a successful search. 
  So I have used JS to disable the buttons until a criteria has been met. 
+ If you try to access any of the web pages that are reserved for account holders, it will redirect you to the login
  page. I did this to help protect people's reports so that only they could modify them. 
+ A new user cannot use the same email as a current user. This is because the functionality of the website uses the
  email address to identify which user to assign the report to. 
+ I ask the user to confirm their password before they can delete their account.
+ The passwords are hashed and a different salt is generated each time a password is made/changed. If anyone hacks into
  database they will not be able to see the passwords.

## Responsive Design

This project has been optimised to the common devices on Google Chrome's Dev Tools.
It has been specifically designed for the following:
   + Moto G4
   + iPhone 6/7/8
   + iPad
   + iPad Pro
   + Laptop with MDPI screen
   + Laptop with HiDPI screen


The majority of the website stays consistent to an easy user experience. There are minor changes to font-sizes etc. Some 
of these can be seen in the [responsive image](static/files/wireframes/responsive-design.jpg). This has been taken from the website:
http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#

There are a few major resposive choices, detailed below.

1. When viewing on a laptop the search results present their information in a different way. The incident description,
date and whether it had been reported are shown in their own colour on the right of the card.

2. The pictures of staff and descriptions shift to being alongside each other once on the laptop/ landscape iPad Pro 
screen.

## Project Evaluation

I believe this website handles its purpose with maturity and simplicity. There is no unnecessary data collected and indeed
there is the option to skip it. The clean UX, complete with a responsive navbar, makes the site very easy to navigate.
All of the links to the user areas are in the same place and easy to access in the navbar. 
This is also complemented by a simple and complimentary colour scheme. They colours are calm and neutral which 
sets the correct tone for the purpose of the website.

There are a variety of way in which you can search through the reports. All of search options are on one webpage
which cuts down on screen loading time. In addition, elements of a form that aren't needed are hidden. Again, this
creates a clean user experience where the user is not over loaded with information.

Giving the user complete control over their own reports helps to promote trust in the website. Users can edit and
even delete their reports at any time. If a user is logged in they will be associated with that report in their dashboard
but no where else on the website. This allows flexibility and anonymity. 

Overall, I think the website has a clear purpose, clean UX and defensive features to ensure the user gets the most
out of the experience.



<span id="improvements"></span>
### Improvements

+ I would like to refactor the code that chooses whether you can search by a date.
+ The menu could have icons on it as a visual reminder.
+ There could be a dashboard button like the settings button on the pages as a shortcut.
+ I need to use an ajax to live check the email addresses when signing up as the regex will become slow and cumbersome 
  as the users grow.
