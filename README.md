# Report On Any Discrimination

## Project proposal

The project aim to create a database of discrimination across the UK. It will allow users to take a stand and 
report any discrimination they experience, hear or see. They can categorise the discrimination and add a location.

Why collect data? Councils have made it clear that they are underfunded and that doesn't appear to be changing any
time soon. Yet, there is a rise in racist and xenophobic attacks across the country. 

This project will be open-sourced and all councils, police, charities and authories will have access to the data.
They can search by area or by discrimination to see where they can focus their efforts and funding.

### Features

Users can do the following:

Add a record of discrimination anonymously or through a login.
Edit or delete records through their login
Search their area and see the statistics of discrimination.
Search for a type of discrimination and see where it is prevalent in the UK.

Future features.
A google api will allow the locations of the features to be displayed as clusters across a map. 
People can filter crimes via a date. 
Export data as a CSV to be used on excel.
Councils to be able to upload reports of discrimination via their own CSV
